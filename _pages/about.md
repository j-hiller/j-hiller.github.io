My name is Johannes Hiller, I am a Data Scientist at the Federal Highway and Transport Research Institute (BASt).
My current work is focussed on the digitization of the road infrastructure and similar areas.
This also involves making use of earth observation data to get a better view of the current status of the road infrastructure.
<!-- My name is Johannes Hiller, I am a Research Assistant at the Insitute for Automotive Engineering (ika) RWTH Aachen University with the aim of pursuing my PhD in mechanical engineering.
My current research at ika is focussed on the safety assurance of automated driving with a focus on data analysis and processing.
Over the last years I have worked in the European research projects [L3Pilot](https://www.l3pilot.eu) and [Hi-Drive](https://www.hi-drive.eu). -->
