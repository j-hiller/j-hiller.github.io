Following the presentation at the ESV 2019, the L3Pilot Common Data Format was made open-source.
This means that the definitions and examples to generate the data files are available via the Github Repository.
The aim is to enable other reseach projects, instituions but also industry to share data for the evaluation of automated driving.
